                    "It’s an LP by Frederik, titled “I’m Dracula”. 12 tracks of old timey, smutty Schlanger with disco effects and way too much synthesizer. Oh, the 80’s. Back in the day, dude was a menace to women, and of course everybody back then thought it was charming or something. Most of the songs are about hitting up girls or “being manly”. Title track’s a banger though.",

It’s cheap plastic for sure, but at least it was designed in pawston by Reggie C. Flippers, a local sculptor. Nice and shiny.",
                    "Wait, this guy was in the same Pee-wee team as me and Hackles? Why can’t I remember him? He would’ve certainly stuck out…I mean, the dude’s a greedy, mouth breathing Shitheel, but it’s kinda cute he kept the trophy. I guess it’s the gold finish."

Birthday cake is the Smokey’s special, Cheeseburger Birthday Blaster, with a one kilo beef patty and kilo and a half of cheese. Everyone looks happy, even Hackles.",
                    "Aww, it’s our tenth birthday! We had some much fun, even if Hackles screwed loose all the salt shakers. Mr.Smokey told him to frig off, but Mom talked him out of it. Dad ate so much cake he had difficulties walking away! Mr. Smokey and Mr. Beaky got a piece, I remember the hunger in his eyes, said the cake was his masterpiece.",
                    "Mr. Beaky was wobbly that day and he was slurring about shithawks... He might be an alcoholic, now that I think of it. Oh, damn. That reminds me, on the week of the accident Mom called and said I should go check on Hackles! She must be worried sick! Not looking forward to that phone call though."
